# R_BGS
A refinement framework for background subtration based on color and depth data

-----------------------------------------------
In order to run our demo, you need to prepare: color and depth data;  foreground results and background results based on color and depth data; groundtruth.

But since the dataset are not published by the oringal author, readers can ask for the datasets by themselves.

Our code is run in Matlab 2016a.
1. Run cppMake.m to compile
2. Run rgbsDemo.m

Enjoy!
